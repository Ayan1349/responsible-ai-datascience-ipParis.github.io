Through this blog post, we'll discuss the paper "BitFit: A Simpler and More Efficient Approach to Fine-tuning Transformers" ([Ben Zaken et al., 2022](#benzaken)).

Fine-tuning large transformer models like BERT has become the standard practice for adapting them to specific tasks. However, full fine-tuning can be extremely memory and computationally expensive. The paper proposed a novel technique called BitFit that offers an alternative and more cost-effective solution by adjusting only the bias terms of the model, leaving most parameters unchanged.

## Why Fine-tuning Needs Optimization



## What is BitFit?



## How Well Does BitFit Perform?



## Why Does BitFit Work?



## Implications and Future Directions



## Conclusion

BitFit defies the usual wisdom concerning universal fine-tuning by illustrating how slight tweaks in only a very small percentage of model parameters yield high-performance. This efficient approach makes AI models more accessible, scalable, and cost-effective.
